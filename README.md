# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I was moivated to challenge myself with learning a new skill.
I built this webpage to help others either studying the same topic or those who are thinking of studying this topic, understand a little more about the process of building a webpage.
During this process I learnt a lot about my own capabilities but also learned that building a webpage and coding is very methodical and that sometimes its easy to make mistakes and that it is good to work with others whilst coding to obtain the best possible solution to the problem.
